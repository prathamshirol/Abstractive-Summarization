# Abstractive Summarization using Transformers

This repository contains a research paper on **Abstractive Summarization using Transformer Models**. The paper provides an in-depth exploration of abstractive text summarization, focusing on how Transformer-based models, particularly the decoder component, can be utilized to produce high-quality summaries. It includes an introduction to the problem, a literature review, the proposed methodology, results, and relevant references in the field.

## Overview

Text summarization is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP), where the goal is to condense a document into a concise version while preserving its key information. This paper focuses on **abstractive summarization**, which generates novel sentences that summarize the original text, unlike extractive summarization which selects entire sentences from the original content.

### Key Topics Covered:
- **Introduction to Text Summarization**: The importance of summarization in handling large volumes of data.
- **Literature Review**: A review of existing methods in both **extractive** and **abstractive summarization**.
- **Proposed Methodology**: An explanation of how Transformer models, particularly the decoder architecture, are used for abstractive summarization.
- **Results**: Evaluation metrics and performance of the model trained on the CNN/DailyMail dataset.
